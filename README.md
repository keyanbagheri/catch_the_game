<h2>App</h2>
Our App was born out of the desire to bring together bars and patrons through team sports. NYC immediately came to mind as the perfect stage because there are so many transplants who may be looking for a bar to go to to watch their home team play. 

With this app, users will be able to view a schedule of events and which bar they could possibly watch a game, create an account and join groups with shared team insterests. 
Bars will be able to use this app as a platform to get new clientele and keep their patrons up-to-date on their events. 

In the timeframe of one week, we should be able to set up our database, test relationships and have 80% of our MVP complete.
